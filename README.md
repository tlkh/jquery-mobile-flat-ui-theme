## jQuery Mobile Flat-UI Theme

Theme for jQuery Mobile based on [Flat-UI](http://designmodo.com/demo/flat-ui/).
Forked from [ququplay/jquery-mobile-flat-ui-theme](https://github.com/ququplay/jquery-mobile-flat-ui-theme) because the last update was more than a year ago, no support for jQuery Mobile 1.4 onwards. Essentially, the project appears to be abandoned in favour of new premium themes. Henceâ€¦

- Updated to support the latest jQuery Mobile 1.4.5
- Slight refinements to design including font weights and shadows
- Replaced internal PNG icons with SVG icons. Faster loading themes and resolution independent! 
- New, nicer looking loader animation
